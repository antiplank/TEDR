A dice rolling Discord bot for The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Rolls any number of dice or facets with an optional modifier and description. Doubles will be bolded and a drama die will be displayed on a roll of a 3d6. The bot will display an embed in the channel it was invoked, with a heading showing the user that invoked it. Triggering message will be deleted after the roll.

Usage: !e xdy <mod> <description>
Examples:
  
!e 3d6 5
  
!e 4d12 -5
  
!e 3d6 1 Initiative(Bob)
  
!e 4d6 2 Damage(Eddie)
  

  This is a labor of love for myself and my friends, please don't think that I take this any more seriously than it deserves :)
